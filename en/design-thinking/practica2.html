                    <p class="think__details__info__title">3.   They know each of the stages of Design Thinking.</p>
                    <p class="think__details__info__cont"><p>It is a process of 5 phases which are:
                    <p>•   Discover (Empathize): It is the basis of the design process, it is about putting yourself in the shoes of the person for whom you are designing and empathizing in their way of thinking and feeling, you must immerse yourself in their mind and heart to understand their needs physical and emotional, who is it ?, what does it do ?, what do you like ?, what is important to him ?, why does he do it that way?
                    <p>•   Interpret (Define): Here we process what we learned from the user in phase one and define our opportunities for innovation, we must design a point of view or starting point this is built from the hunches of our user.
                    <p>•   Idear (Idear): In this stage all the ideas are valid, the evaluation will come later, now the most important thing is to generate the greatest amount and variety of possible ideas, for example with a brainstorming that is the technique par excellence to generate ideas, the best of this technique is that it drives collective thinking through conversation listening and building on other ideas must be allowed to collide and complement in an unusual way, we must turn off the serious and evaluative side of the brain and work with the generative part, we have to attract us down the door of fears, modesty conservative ideas, fear of ridicule and failure, and drop everything that comes to mind, because an idea can not be great in itself but can bring with it the idea that the team seeks , for a brainstorming to work, there must always be a person to guide and stimulate the group so that everyone is willing to go in search of ideas.
                    <p>•   Experiment (Prototype): Here we create tangible elements such as images, artefacts, models, storyborard or simulated activities such as scketch that allow us to approve our ideas, interact with them, debate, and get closer to the final solution. A prototype allows us to fail cheaply, fail quickly and fail often until we find the path we are looking for, and we can develop different ideas without having to compromise with any. If an image is worth more than a hundred words, a prototype is worth more than a thousand images, we create it to be able to converse with our user in front of a real object or situation and evaluate its multiple components.
                    <p>•   Evolve (Test): in this phase it is important to remember everything you learned during the process, that you order it and use it to improve the prototype. To achieve a human-oriented innovation your final product must be evaluated according to three well-articulated components, desirability on the part of the user, feasibility to do it for those who carry it out and functionality is to say if the improvements are aimed at solve the need effectively and finally prepare a high impact communication campaign to stimulate the acceptance of users and entities that want to invest in the project.
